  "body": "6,3,5d\n\t\t\t\t\tKelsen 1961, S. 439f.: \"The idea of equality, …,does not actually proclaim anything more than thelogical principle of identity or the principle of contra-diction. It conveys no more than the idea of order, ofunity within the system … Since in reality there areno two individuals perfectly equal, equality as S. 440a principle of justice means that certain differencesbetween individuals are to be considered as irrelevant.The question, however, whether in a given case, A and Bare 'equal' or not, and that means, which differences,actually existing between A and B, are irrelevant, cannotbe answered by natural-law doctrine. The answer isgiven exclusively by positive law. The principle ofequality, as a principle of justice implies only thatif A is to be treated in a certain way and B equalsA, it follows that B must be treated in the sameway. Otherwise there would be a logical contradiction;"
