For it failed utterly toaccount for objective connection, order and regularity inobjects observed. Similarly, any doctrine that identifiesthe mere fact of being liked with the value of the objectliked so fails to give direction to conduct when directionis needed that is automatically calls forth the assertionthat there are values eternally in Being that are the standardsof all judgement and the obligatory ends of all action.Without the introduction of operational thinking, weoscillate between a theory that, in order to save the objectivi-ty of judgments of values, isolates them from experienceand nature, and a theory that, in order to save theirconcrete human significance, reduces them tothese statements about our own feelings.\""
