Other examples are given by functions like'earlier', 'ancestor', and 'equal'. We define thecontrary, or intransitive, function by the postulate (x) (y) (z) [f(x,y) · f(y,z) ⊃ (f(x.z)]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(15) Thus 'father' is an intransitive function; if x is thefather of y, and y is the father of z, x is not the fatherof z, but the grandfather.
