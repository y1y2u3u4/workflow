  "body": "5,15 Zu den Auswirkungen politischer Kontrolle auf die Verwaltungs-t√§tigkeit und Verwaltungsorganisation: Renold, in Milward, S. 218: \"Liability to detailed publicscrutiny and criticism cannot help but colour the wholeapproach to the question of organisation. The top authoritymust be in a position to explain and justify all actions of itsemployees. In order to minimise occasions for justification,all such actions must be regulated by the book. Theavoidance of mistakes becomes a cardinal consideration,and decentralisation can therefore hardly be permitted. Infact the whole organisation must tend to be designed forthe avoidance of mistakes rather than for enterprise. In theinterest of safety it must tend towards centralisedcontrol\"."
