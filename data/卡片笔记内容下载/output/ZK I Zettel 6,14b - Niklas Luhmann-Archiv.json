The contextualist's answer, it seems tome, is that when someone perceives two or more objectsas similar – that is, fails to distinguish between them in agiven situation with respect to some property – he acceptsboth as having strands which lead to the same point, orset of points, in a schematic texture of some sort. …This point, or set of points represents the region or rangewithin which an identical sensory reaction may be had.In this situation the two objects lead to (or converge upon)a single reaction. Either object may be used to producethis reaction …\n\t\t\t\t\tS. 81\n\t\t\t\t\t… the identity is not absolute, however,in the sense that it will apply to any and all situations,for in another situation involving more exactingconditions the two objects may not converge uponthe same response … On the contextualistic view"
