The problem of restoring integrationand cooperation between man's beliefs about the world in whichhe lives and his beliefs about the values and purposes that shoulddirect his conduct is the deepest problem of modern life.\" Oder S. 40f.: \"It is more or less of a commonplace to speak of the crisis whichhas been caused by the progress of the natural sciences in the last fewcenturies. The crisis is due, it is asserted, to the incompatibilitybetween the conclusions of natural sciences about the world inwhich we live and the realm of higher values, [S. 41] of ideal and spiritualqualities, which get no support from natural science. The newscience, it is said, has stripped the world of the qualities whichmade it beautiful and congenial to men; has deprived natureof all aspiration towards ends, all preference for accomplishingthe good and presented nature to us as a scene of indifferentphysical particles acting according to mathematical and mechani-cal laws."
