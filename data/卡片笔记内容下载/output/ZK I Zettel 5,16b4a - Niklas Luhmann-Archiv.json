Insofar as close supervision springs frommanagement's perception of workers as failingto perform their role-obligations and as beingunmotivated, the institution of rules in noway suffices to resolve this problem. The rulesdo not recharge the worker's motivation, butmerely enable him to know what the mangement'sexpectations are and to give them minimalconformance\"."
